# 100xDevs - Cohort 3.0

This repository contains my learning journey and code from Harkirat Singh's 100xDevs Cohort 3.0 program. It's organized week by week with all lecture code, assignments, and projects.

## Course Overview

[100xDevs](https://100xdevs.com/) is a comprehensive full-stack web development cohort led by Harkirat Singh, focusing on modern JavaScript technologies and real-world applications.

## My Progress

Here's an overview of my weekly progress throughout the cohort:

- **Async JavaScript**:
  - JavaScript runtime and call stack
  - Synchronous vs asynchronous code
  - I/O and CPU-bound tasks
  - Working with callbacks
- **Promises**:
  - Promise API and chaining
  - Error handling
  - Callback hell and solutions
  - Classes and inheritance in JavaScript

### Week 04 - Node.js & HTTP Servers
- **Node.js Fundamentals**:
  - Node.js vs Bun
  - Setting up Node.js projects
  - NPM and package management
  - Working with internal and external packages
  - File system operations
  - Command-line interfaces
- **HTTP Servers**:
  - Building HTTP servers from scratch
  - Routing and handling requests
  - Creating RESTful APIs
- **Express Framework**:
  - Setting up Express applications
  - Building backend APIs
  - Working with middlewares
  - Request/response cycle

### Week 05 - Advanced Backend Concepts
- **API Communication**:

  - Working with Axios
  - Creating HTTP servers
- **Middlewares & CORS**:
  - Inline and global middlewares
  - Logging and monitoring requests
  - Using Express.json middleware
  - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
  - Building secure APIs

## Running the Code

Most files can be run using Node.js:

```bash
node <file-path>
```

For web projects and servers:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start` or `node index.js`

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM Manipulation
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **APIs**: REST, Fetch, Axios
- **Tools**: NPM, Git
